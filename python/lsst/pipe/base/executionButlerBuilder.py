    r"""buildExecutionButler is a function that is responsible for exporting
    input `QuantumGraphs` into a new minimal `~lsst.daf.butler.Butler` which
    only contains datasets specified by the `QuantumGraph`. These datasets are
    both those that already exist in the input `~lsst.daf.butler.Butler`, and
    those that are expected to be produced during the execution of the
    `QuantumGraph`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    butler : `lsst.daf.butler.Bulter`
        This is the existing `~lsst.daf.butler.Butler` instance from which
        existing datasets will be exported. This should be the
        `~lsst.daf.butler.Butler` which was used to create any `QuantumGraphs`
        that will be converted with this object.
    graph : `QuantumGraph`
        Graph containing nodes that are to be exported into an execution
        butler
    outputLocation : convertible to `ResourcePath
        URI Location at which the execution butler is to be exported. May be
        specified as a string or a `ResourcePath` instance.
    run : `str` optional
        The run collection that the exported datasets are to be placed in. If
        None, the default value in registry.defaults will be used.
    clobber : `bool`, Optional
        By default a butler will not be created if a file or directory
        already exists at the output location. If this is set to `True`
        what is at the location will be deleted prior to running the
        export. Defaults to `False`
    butlerModifier : `~typing.Callable`, Optional
        If supplied this should be a callable that accepts a
        `~lsst.daf.butler.Butler`, and returns an instantiated
        `~lsst.daf.butler.Butler`. This callable may be used to make any
        modifications to the `~lsst.daf.butler.Butler` desired. This
        will be called after importing all datasets that exist in the input
        `~lsst.daf.butler.Butler` but prior to inserting Datasets expected
        to be produced. Examples of what this method could do include
        things such as creating collections/runs/ etc.
    collections : `~typing.Iterable` of `str`, Optional
        An iterable of collection names that will be exported from the input
        `~lsst.daf.butler.Butler` when creating the execution butler. If not
        supplied the `~lsst.daf.butler.Butler`\ 's `~lsst.daf.butler.Registry`
        default collections will be used.

    Returns
    -------
    executionButler : `lsst.daf.butler.Butler`
        An instance of the newly created execution butler

    Raises
